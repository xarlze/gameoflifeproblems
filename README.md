## Summary
Game of Life Problems consists of a character and obstacles that the player needs to avoid by manipulating the position of the character.

## Mechanism
Through the keyboard actions of ↑,	↓,	→,	←, the player will relocate the ball to avoid incoming obstacles on the screen. The game checks, every 100ms, if any obstacles' center distance to the character's center is smaller or equal to the sum of their radius. If so, a function will "kill" the character and declare the game as over. The game is powered by HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript.

## Navigation
