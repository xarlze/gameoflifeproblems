## Summary
Game of Life Problems consists of a character and obstacles that the player needs to avoid by manipulating the position of the character.

## Mechanism
Though keyboard actions of ↑,	↓,	→,	←, players will relocate the ball to an obstacle-free space. The game checks, every 100ms, if any obstacles' center distance to the character's center is smaller or equal to the sum of their radius. If so, a function will "kill" the character and declare the game as over.
